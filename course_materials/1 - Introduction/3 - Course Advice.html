<p><strong>Questions</strong></p><p>If at any point during the course you encounter any problem, or have any other questions or feedback, please do search/ask in the Q&amp;A area.&nbsp; See <a href="https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/229233387-How-to-Ask-a-Question-About-a-Course-You-re-Taking-" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How to Ask a Question About a Course You're Taking</a> in the Udemy help pages if you're not familiar with the Q&amp;A functionality.</p><p><strong>Coding Along</strong></p><p>The recommended way to take this course is to follow along with the example projects shown in the videos, by coding them on your own.&nbsp; However, I recommend you watch each lecture <em>in full</em> first, focusing on the concepts being explained, rather than trying to write the code at the same time as you watch.&nbsp; Then after each lecture you can try re-implementing the same steps on your own.</p><p>I typically show a quick recap of the relevant code at the end of each video to make this easier.&nbsp; You'll also find a <em>Code Diff</em> link in the <em>Resources</em> for each lecture, linking to right the commit page on Github that shows the changes.</p>
